    To change the alignment trap behavior, simply echo a number into
    /proc/cpu/alignment.  The number is made up from various bits:

    bit     behavior when set
    ---     -----------------

    0       A user process performing an unaligned memory access
            will cause the kernel to print a message indicating
            process name, pid, pc, instruction, address, and the
            fault code.

    1       The kernel will attempt to fix up the user process
            performing the unaligned access.  This is of course
            slow (think about the floating point emulator) and
            not recommended for production use.

    2       The kernel will send a SIGBUS signal to the user process
            performing the unaligned access.

    Note that not all combinations are supported - only values 0 through 5.
    (6 and 7 don't make sense).

    For example, the following will turn on the warnings, but without
    fixing up or sending SIGBUS signals:

        echo 1 > /proc/sys/debug/alignment
