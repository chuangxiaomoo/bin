# tcl.expect

# string.compare

There are 2 strings:
string1: "Apple a day"
string2: "Apple a day keeps doctor away"

    1) puts [string equal $string2 *$string1*] : Output: 0
    2) puts [string match $string2 *$string1*] : Output: 0
    3) puts [string compare $string2 *$string1*] : Output: 1

string equal tests if the strings are equal

string match looks to see if the first string is a substring of the second (it's the other way round in your case, so you got 0)

string compare checks which string comes first and which comes second if you sort them, and retruns -1, 0 or 1.

There's also regexp for you to look at
