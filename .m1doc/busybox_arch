(1) busybox 代码的高超之处 applets.h 中对于宏的运用可谓是炉火纯青：
        applets.c include applets.h twice, 

        1st time in busybox.h and 
        2nd time in applets.c. 
        The 1st time is when PROTOTYPES definde, so it's just PROTOTYPES declare, 
        and the 2nd time is construct the array -> 
                const struct BB_applet applets[] it's amazing.
