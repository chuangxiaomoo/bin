    SELECT region, SUM(population), SUM(area) FROM bbc GROUP BY region

    ---> 先分组，再聚合的
    SELECT region FROM bbc GROUP BY region | SUM(population), SUM(area)


. WHERE and HAVING

    SELECT *,(close-yesc)/yesc as rise FROM day WHERE 
        date=(SELECT max(date) FROM day) HAVING rise > 0.08  ORDER by rise DESC ;

    WHERE 子句中不能有函数及计算引用，但是 HAVING 可以有。
