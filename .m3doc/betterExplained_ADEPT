# ADEPT

The Mental Checklist
I used to be satisfied with a technical description and practice problem. Not anymore.

ADEPT is a checklist of what I need to feel comfortable with an idea. I don’t think I’ve actually learned a topic unless I have a metaphor that ties everything together. Here’s a few places to look:

. Analogy – ?
. Diagram – Google Images
. Example – Khan Academy for practice problems
. Plain-English – Forums like /r/math or Math Overflow
. Technical – Wikipedia or MathWorld

Unfortunately, there aren’t many resources focused on analogies, especially for math, so you have to make your own. (This site exists to share mine.)

# Bonus: BE ADEPT

“BE” is a nice prefix for the style to use when teaching:

Brevity is beautiful.

Empathy makes us human. Use your natural style, relate to common experience, and anticipate questions in your explanation.

I’ve yet to complain that a lesson respected my time too much, or related too well to how I thought.
