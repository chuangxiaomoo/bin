# 09_Socrates

[](http://www.juzimi.com/writer/苏格拉底)
我只知道一件事，就是我什么都不知道。
想左右天下的人，须先能左右自己。
“一个好女人，能把男人变成快乐的人，一个坏女人，能把男人变成哲学家。”（via 苏格拉底）
这个世界上有两种人，一种是快乐的猪，一种是痛苦的人。做痛苦的人，不做快乐的猪。
最热烈的恋爱，会有最冷漠的结局。
认识自己的无知就是最大的智慧。
The unexamined life is not worth living. 
逆境是磨练人的最高学府。
一个人能否有成就，只看他是否具备自尊心与自信心两个条件。
骄傲是无知的产物。
在你发怒的时候，要紧闭你的嘴，免得增加你的怒气。
我与世界相遇，我自与世界相蚀，我自不辱使命，使我与众生相聚。
The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less. 
真正高明的人，就是能够借助别人的智慧，来使自己不受蒙蔽的人。
时间到了，我们各走各的路，是活在这个世上好还是死了好，只有神知道答案。
我们的需要是越少，我们越近似上帝。
我不是一个智慧的人，我只是一个爱智慧的人。

# Socratic method (dialectic method of inquiry, or elenchus, or Socratic irony)

The Socratic method is a <negative method> of hypothesis elimination, in that 
better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. 
It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.

# Knowledge(无知vs.全知)

The statement "I know that I know nothing" is often attributed to Socrates, based on a statement in Plato's Apology.[69]() 
The conventional interpretation of this is that Socrates' wisdom was limited to an awareness of his own <ignorance=非存在>.

# what makes a good king?

Tywin:  Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means? [Lord Tywin steps closer as Tommen eyes him suspiciously]() I'm not trying to trick you. 
Tommen: It means I'll become king. 
Tywin:  Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be? 
Tommen: A good king? 
Tywin:  Hm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. 
        But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?—
Cersei: This is hardly the place or the time. 
Tommen: [the cub ignores his mother with an expression of curiosity]() Holiness? 

# 权力的游戏？

Varys:  "Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. 
        And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
蜘蛛：  权力存于人心。信则有，不信则无。惑人的把戏，如<浮影游墙>。即便是矮小之人，也能投射出巨大的影子。
