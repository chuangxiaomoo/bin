目前通过破译市场领先指标以得到未来线索，就像迂回于故宫里一般，每道半掩的门都通向皇宫里更深的庭院，而外墙、屋檐却只有细微的差别，只有经过反复的推敲方能领悟最终的预示。

这些问题如果不能得到解决，或许有一天会像被晒热了的榴莲突然爆开。


# 《双城记》最初版本的开篇：

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, 
it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, 
it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, 
it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, 
it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, 

we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - 

in short, the period was so far like the present period, 
that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, 
for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

时之圣者也，时之凶者也。
此亦智慧世，此亦蒙昧世。
此亦光明时节，此亦黯淡时节。
此亦笃信之年，此亦大惑之年。
此亦多丽之阳春，此亦绝念之穷冬。

人或万物具备，人或一事无成。
我辈其青云直上，我辈其黄泉永坠。
