# meditation

Meditation is about NOTHING.
Meditation is about being present, being in the here and now, struggling with being in the here and now.
And when we lose our thought, when we lose our focus on the breath, simply bring it back.
That is the practice, losing it and bring it back - LOSING IT AND BRING IT BACK.
And that's how we excerise our mind to be more focused, to be more mindful.
