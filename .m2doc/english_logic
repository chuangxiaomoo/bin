# 句子分析

**阅读速度很大一部分来于短时间内理解长难句的能力**，阅读的基本单位不应该是词汇，而应该是句子。

1. 演绎法：以动词为树根的树。以广度搜索方式处理。
2. 归纳法：根据最常见的深度为3，常见方法进行分解分类。找出主干即解决了两层逻辑。

# 逻辑英语: 本质是翻译.关键在**中英文修饰限定成分（modifier）的安排习惯不一样**

modifier可以分两类（任何句子都一样）：

1. 名词的modifier，权且记为*M-ADJ*；M-ADJ在空间上要尽可能紧贴其修饰对象；
2. 其他的modifier，权且记为*M-ADV*：M-ADV则较为灵活，在句中还经常用逗号引导。(整句/形容词/副词...)

eng    (状1)        主 (`定1`) 谓 (`状2`) (宾)  (*定2*|状1)
chn    (状1|`定1`)  主 (`状2`) 谓 (*定2*) (宾)        (状1)

1. 主干一致，状语1一致，剩下的都是颠倒的
2. 并列不变序 chn: 1(234)(567) -> eng: (432)(765)1

框架之后，是语法+单词

I love U.
Last year, I love U.

中文是靠语气虚词改变句型结构的。
英文定语必靠后，你理解的`在定的定语`应该是 adj.+noun. 组成的名词短语，是一整体。

# 两找两辨，长句化简

一个句子只有一个动词(verb.)，长难句 = 分解() + 简化(去修饰) [](https://www.cnblogs.com/hughdong/p/6992186.html)

找谓语动词: can/will, be, have/do...
找连接词:   that, wh-, how, if, because...
辨从句:     每个连接词之后皆有一个从句
辨语句:     从句之余便是主语

Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business.

句子语法难点：
这句话是非限定性定语从句，难点在句子的主语和宾语都有较长的短语和of结构限定，而且是由两个分居and相连的3个部分组成的。
分句an element…landowners 又带有两个定语从句，一个是(which was) representing… , 另一个是(which was) detached…。
从以上句子可以知道，定语从句的难点在于经常省略引导词+be的结构，所以在句子理解上容易和分词结构混淆。

1. 这个句子的主要修饰成分就是从句和非谓语动词，大家务必想清楚，**每一个修饰成分修饰的是什么**，才能看清楚这个句子的结构。
2. 句子的结构在本质上是一棵语法树，我们在阅读时应该使用**广度遍历**算法，而非**深度遍历**。e.g. (draperies she wore)
3. 概念说明式的宾语从句，可以理解为两棵并列的树，因此翻译到汉语时有object(舞蹈)的重复。
