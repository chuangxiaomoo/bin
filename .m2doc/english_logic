# 句子分析

bool逻辑 && || ! 对应的自然语言逻辑: 并列、递进、转折

**阅读速度很大一部分来于短时间内理解长难句的能力**，阅读的基本单位不应该是词汇，而应该是句子。

1. 演绎法：以动词为树根的树。以广度搜索方式处理。
2. 归纳法：根据最常见的深度为3，常见方法进行分解分类。找出主干即解决了两层逻辑。

[Grammarly Grammar Checker](https://www.bloggertipstricks.com/online-grammar-checker-tools.html)

# 逻辑英语: 本质是翻译.关键在**中英文修饰限定成分（modifier）的安排习惯不一样**

modifier可以分两类（任何句子都一样）：

1. 名词的modifier，权且记为*M-ADJ*；M-ADJ在空间上要尽可能紧贴其修饰对象；
2. 其他的modifier，权且记为*M-ADV*：M-ADV则较为灵活，在句中还经常用逗号引导。(整句/形容词/副词...)

eng    (状1)        主 (`定1`) 谓 (`状2`) (宾)  (*定2*|状1)
chn    (状1|`定1`)  主 (`状2`) 谓 (*定2*) (宾)        (状1)

1. 主干一致，状语1一致，剩下的都是颠倒的
2. 并列不变序 chn: 1(234)(567) -> eng: (432)(765)1

框架之后，是语法+单词

I love U.
Last year, I love U.

中文是靠语气虚词改变句型结构的。
英文定语必靠后，你理解的`在定的定语`应该是 adj.+noun. 组成的名词短语，是一整体。

# 两找两辨，长句化简

一个句子只有一个动词(verb.)，长难句 = 分解() + 简化(去修饰) [](https://www.cnblogs.com/hughdong/p/6992186.html)

找谓语动词: can/will, be, have/do...
找连接词:   that, wh-, how, if, because...
辨从句:     每个连接词之后皆有一个从句
辨语句:     从句之余便是主语

# 树形分析法

1 英语句子有七种基本成分(members of the sentence)，分别为:主语、谓语、宾语、定语、状语、表语、宾语补足语。
2 英语的5种基本句型
3 广度搜索法则

细节如下:
1 以缩进代表句子级别
2 从句引导词单独一行
3 连词(并列、递进、转折)单独一行
4 成分(主、谓、宾、表)独一行
5 定状不换行
6 作补: 分词以从句待遇，进行`缩进`；作补: 不定式、形容词不缩进
7 介词短语
8 {动词+介词+名词}合为一行
  be. + noun. + prep.
  vt. + noun. + prep.

Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business.

句子语法难点：
这句话是非限定性定语从句，难点在句子的主语和宾语都有较长的短语和of结构限定，而且是由两个分居and相连的3个部分组成的。
分句an element…landowners 又带有两个定语从句，一个是(which was) representing… , 另一个是(which was) detached…。
从以上句子可以知道，定语从句的难点在于经常省略引导词+be的结构，所以在句子理解上容易和分词结构混淆。
