# Keynes & Hayek: Fear the Boom and Bust

We’ve been [going back and forth]() for a century
Keynes: I want to [steer]() markets,
Hayek: I want them set free
There’s a [boom and bust cycle]() and good reason to fear it
Hayek: Blame low interest rates.
Keynes: No… it’s the [animal spirits]()

Keynes Sings:

John Maynard Keynes, wrote the book on [modern macro](现代宏观)
The man you need when the economy’s [off track](), WHOA!
[Depression, recession]() now your question’s in session    []()
Have a seat and I’ll school you in one simple lesson

BOOM, 1929 the big crash                              [boom](发隆隆声)
We didn’t bounce back—economy’s in the trash
Persistent unemployment, the result of                [sticky wages]()
Waiting for recovery? Seriously? That’s [outrageous!] (aut'reidj2s 粗暴的；可恶的；令人吃惊的)

I had a real plan any fool can understand
The advice, real simple—boost aggregate demand!       [gross]('@grigeit)
C, I, G, all together gets to Y                       [C+I+G+X-M=Y](  C=consumption,I=private investment, G=government spending, 
                                                                      Y=GDP X-M, X=exports, M= imports, C+I+G=A=aggregate spending)
Make sure the total’s growing, watch the economy fly

We’ve been going back and forth for a century
Keynes: I want to steer markets,
Hayek: I want them set free
There’s a boom and bust cycle and good reason to fear it
Hayek: Blame low interest rates.
Keynes: No… it’s the animal spirits

You see it’s all about spending, hear the register cha-ching      [模仿收银机打开的声音]()
Circular flow, the dough is everything                            [循环流动]() [dough](d2u 生面团.金钱.票子)
So if that flow is getting low, doesn’t matter the reason
We need more government spending, now it’s stimulus season

So forget about saving, get it straight out of your head
Like I said, in the long run—we’re all dead
Savings is destruction, that’s the [paradox of thrift]()
Don’t keep money in your pocket, or that growth will never lift…

because…

Business is driven by the animal spirits
The bull and the bear, and there’s reason to fear its
Effects on capital investment, income and growth
That’s why the state should fill the gap with stimulus both…

The monetary and the fiscal, they’re equally correct              [货币和财政]('mʌnɪtɛri 'fisk2l)
Public works, digging ditches, war has the same effect            [罗斯福]()
Even a broken window helps the glass man have some wealth
The multiplier driving higher the economy’s health

And if the Central Bank’s interest rate policy tanks              [tanks](v. 把…储在容器；打败)
A liquidity trap, that new money’s stuck in the banks!            [stick]()
Deficits could be the cure, you been looking for
Let the spending soar, now that you know the score                [let...fly]()

My General Theory’s made quite an impression                      [让人眼前一亮]()
<a revolution> I transformed the econ profession
You know me, modesty, still I’m taking a bow
Say it loud, say it proud, we’re all Keynesians now

We’ve been goin’ back n forth for a century
Keynes: I want to steer markets,
Hayek: I want them set free
There’s a boom and bust cycle and good reason to fear it
Keynes: I made my case, Freddie H                                 [陈述自己的观点]()
Listen up , Can you hear it?

Hayek sings:

I’ll begin [in broad strokes](), just like my friend Keynes
His theory conceals the mechanics of change,
That simple equation, too much aggregation
Ignores human action and motivation

And yet it continues as a justification                           [为错误政策提供辩护]()
For [bailouts and payoffs]() by [pols with machinations]()        [阴谋诡计]('m@k2,neic2n)
You provide them [with cover]() to sell us a free lunch
Then all that we’re left with is debt, and a bunch

If you’re living high on that cheap credit hog
Don’t look for cure from the hair of the dog                      []( 醒酒液 ; 解宿醉的一杯酒 ; 以毒攻毒 ; 所谓的宿醉还得酒来解)
Real savings come first if you want to invest
The market coordinates time with interest

Your focus on spending [is pushing on thread](不奏效)
In the long run, my friend, it’s your theory that’s dead
So sorry there, buddy, if that sounds like [invective]()
Prepared to get schooled in my Austrian perspective

We’ve been going back and forth for a century
Keynes: I want to steer markets,
Hayek: I want them set free
There’s a boom and bust cycle and good reason to fear it
Hayek: Blame low interest rates.
Keynes: No… it’s the animal spirits

The place you should study isn’t the bust
It’s the boom that should make you feel [leery](li2ri 狡猾的), that’s the [thrust]('tsr^st 力推的)
Of my theory, the capital structure is key.
Malinvestments wreck the economy

The boom gets started with an expansion of credit
The Fed sets rates low, are you starting to get it?
That new money is confused for real loanable funds
But it’s just [inflation]() that’s driving the ones

Who invest in new projects like housing construction
The boom [plants the seeds for]() its future destruction
The savings aren’t real, consumption’s up too
And the [grasping]() for resources reveals there’s too few

So the boom turns to bust as the interest rates rise
With the costs of production, price signals were lies
The boom was a binge that’s a matter of fact                  [binge](bindj 狂欢)
Now its devalued capital that [makes up the slack]            (弥补缺口).

Whether it’s the late twenties or two thousand and five
Booming bad investments, seems like they’d thrive
You must save to invest, don’t use the printing press
Or a bust will surely follow, an economy depressed

Your so-called “stimulus” will make things even worse
It’s just more of the same, more incentives [perversed](邪恶的)
And that [credit crunch]() ain’t a liquidity trap
Just a broke banking system, I’m done, that’s a wrap.

We’ve been goin’ back n forth for a century
Keynes: I want to steer markets,
Hayek: I want them set free
There’s a boom and bust cycle and good reason to fear it
Hayek: Blame low interest rates.
Keynes: No it’s the animal spirits

# Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Round 2: “Fight of the Century”
 
NTRO: John Maynard Keynes. F. A. Hayek Round Two. Round 2.0 Same economists. Same beliefs. New microphones. New Mustaches. Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go.

KEYNES: Here we are. Peace out. Great Recession. Thanks to ME. As you see. We’re not in a depression. Recovery. Destiny. If you follow my lesson. More Keynes. Here I come. Line up for the procession.

HAYEK: We brought out the shovels and we’re still in a ditch. And still digging. Don’t you think it’s time for a switch from that hair of the dog. Friend the party is over, the long run is here, it’s time to get sober.

KEYNES: Are you kidding? My cure works perfectly fine. Have a look. The recession ended in ’09. I deserve credit. Things would have been worse. All the estimates prove it. I’ll go chapter and verse.

HAYEK: Econometricians, they’re ever too pious. Are they doing real science or confirming their bias? Their Keynesian models are tidy and neat. But that top down approach is a fatal conceit.

KEYNES: We could have done better if we’d only spent more. Too bad that only happens when there’s a world war. You can carp all you want about stats and regression. Do you deny that world war cut short the Depression?

HAYEK: Wow. One data point and you’re jumping for joy. The last time I checked wars only destroy. There was no multiplier. Consumption just shank as we used scarce resources for every new tank. Pretty perverse to call that prosperity. Ration meat. Ration butter. A life of austerity. When that war spending ended, your friends cried disaster. Yet the economy thrived and grew faster.

KEYNES: You too only see what you want to see. The spending on war clearly goosed GDP. Unemployment was over, almost down to zero. That’s why I’M the master. That’s why I’M the hero.

HAYEK: Creating employment is a straight forward craft when the nation’s at war and there’s a draft. If every worker were staffed in the army and fleet we’d have full employment and nothing to eat.

HAYEK: Jobs are a means, not the end in themselves. People work to live better, to put food on the shelves. Real growth means production of what people demand. That’s entrepreneurship, not your central plan.

KEYNES: My solution is simple and easy to handle. It’s spending that matters. Why’s that such a scandal. Money sloshes through the pipes and the sluices. Revitalizing the economy’s juices. It’s just like an engine that’s stalled and gone dark. To bring it to life we need a quick spark. Spending the life blood that gets the flow going. Were it goes doesn’t matter. Just Get Spending Flowing.

HAYEK: You see slack in some sectors as a general glut. But some sectors are health only some in a rut. So spending’s not free, that’s the heart of the matter. Too much is wasted as cronies get fatter. The economy’s not a car. There’s no engine to stall. No experts can fix it. There’s no “it” at all. The economy is us. Put away your wrenches, the economy is organic.

KEYNES: So what would YOU do to help those unemployed? This is the question you seem to avoid. When we’re in a mess, would you have us just wait, doing nothing until markets equilibrate?

HAYEK: I don’t wanna do nothing, there’s plenty to do. The question I ponder is who plans for whom. Do I plan for myself or I leave it to you. I want plans by the many, not by the few. Let’s not repeat what created our troubles. I want real growth not a series of bubbles. Stop bailing out losers, let prices work. If we don’t try to steer them they won’t go berserk.

KEYNES: Come on are you kidding? Don’t Wall Street gyrations challenge the world view of self regulation? Even you must admit that lesson we’ve learned is more oversight is needed or else we’ll get burned.

HAYEK: Oversight? The government’s long been in bed with those Wall Street execs and the firms that they’ve bled. Capitalism is about profit and loss. You bail out the losers there is no end to the cost. The lesson I’ve learned is how little we know. The world is complex, not some circular flow. The economy is not a class you master in college, to think otherwise is the pretense of knowledge.

KEYNES: You’ve been on your high horse and you are off to the the races. I look at the world on a case-by-case basis. When people are suffering I roll up my sleeves and do what I can to cure our disease. The future’s uncertain, our outlooks are frail. That’s why markets are so prone to fail. In a volatile world we need more discretion so state intervention can counter depression.

HAYEK: People aren’t chess men you move on a board at your whim, their dreams and desires ignored. With political incentives, discretion’s a joke. Those dials are twisting – just mirrors and smoke. We need stable rules and real market prices so prosperity emerges and cuts short the crisis. Give us a chance so we can discover the most valuable ways to serve one another.
