*6* faith
    "Soldiers Sortie", when the others playing card, he don't, when they 
    others paly chess, he don't, he just say, it's meaningless, and he
    just do thing like building a road. Thing is such simple like this, a
    guy who get the faith, and put all his energy into it. This is the 
    most simple and effective way to success, but most of guys doubt when
    they do something, they'll ask Once I failed, how to?
