
一、我是菜鸟的日子

    /* I am a newbie, but I am sure I'll be a veteran, now I hate something,
     * from the veterans around me.
     * below are the $bore
     */

    1. hate the boss go around or ask the improvements, it's boring.
       boss ask me to have another fish fried when I was busy.

    2. after I fried the fish boss assigned, he doesn't audit it in time 
       but put off it again and again.

    3. worn out of the responsibilitise, and blame to us.

    4. don't have a good schedule, waste the time of all guys.


    解决方案：
        1. 反抽风式管理，培养下属定时反馈的习惯

        2. 先积极做好自己的部分。先做关键路径、再做配套。

        3. 贡献、责任、承诺(敏捷的重承诺)



二、新人培养

    按照招募时的承诺来做！

    It might seem burdensome for a single mentor to spend an hour per day for
    a new hire's first 4 weeks on the job, but that investment represents
    less than 1% of the total time that hire will spend in a year and has
    significantly high leverage in determining whether the person is set up
    for success.
