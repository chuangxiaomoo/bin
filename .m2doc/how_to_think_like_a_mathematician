# 虚数可对应平面上的纵轴，与对应平面上横轴的实数同样真实

**数系**的发展，缘自数系中数进行“运算”后不能**封闭**，而进行的逐步扩充。

# Chapter 0

As I went through my mathematical career, there were many instances when I thought, ‘**I wish someone had told me that earlier.**’ This is a collection of such advice.

# Part I Study Skills For Mathematicians

# Chapter 1 Sets and functions

o A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
o The empty set has no elements.
o The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in the set.
o The set Y is a subset of X if every element of Y is in X.
o A subset Y of X is a proper subset if it is not equal to X.
o The union of X and Y is the collection of elements that are in X or in Y .
o The intersection of X and Y is the collection of elements that are in X and in Y .
o The product of X and Y is the set of all pairs (x, y) where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y .
o A function assigns elements of one set to another.

# CHAPTER 2 Reading mathematics

*Do the exercises and problems*
  Most modern mathematics books have exercises and problems. It is hard to overplay the importance of doing these. Mathematics is an activity. Think of yourself as not studying mathematics, but doing mathematics. 

  Imagine yourself as having a mathematics muscle. It needs exercise to be-come developed. **Passive reading is like watching someone else training with weights, it won’t build your muscles** – you have to do the exercises.

  Furthermore, just because you have read something it does not mean you truly understand it. Answering the exercises and problems identifies your mis-conceptions and misunderstandings. Regularly I hear from students that they can understand a topic, it’s just that they can’t do the exercises, or can’t apply the material. Basically, my rule is, if I can’t do the exercises, then I don’t understand the topic.

*Move on*
  It is unlikely that understanding will come from excessive rereading of a difficult passage. 
  If you are rereading, then it is probably a sign that you are not active – 
  so do some exercises, ask some questions and so on. 

o Read with a purpose 
o Read actively.  Have pen and paper with you.
o You do not have to read in sequence but read systematically.
o Ask questions.
o Read the definitions, theorems and examples first.  The proofs can come later.
o Check the text by applying formulas, etc.
o Move on if you are stuck.
o Write a summary.
o Reflect – What have you learned?

# CHAPTER 3 Writing mathematics 1

o Write in simple, punctuated sentences.
o Keep it simple.
o Explain what you are doing.
o Explain your assertions.
o Say what you mean.
o In general, use words rather than symbols.
o Use equals properly – equals means equals.
o Don’t draw arrows everywhere – use symbols or numbers to identify equa-tions.
o Proof read.
o Reflect. (ask ‘What can I take away?’ and ‘What can I add?’)

# CHAPTER 5 How to solve problems 

It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It is that they can’t see the problem.
    G.K. Chesterton, The Scandal of Father Brown – The Point of a Pin 

Polya’s Four Step Plan The classic book on problem-solving is How to solve it by G. Polya.  For solving any type of problem – not just mathematical ones – he gives a four point plan: 
1. Understand the problem. 
2. Devise a plan. 
3. Execute the plan. 
4. Look back.
