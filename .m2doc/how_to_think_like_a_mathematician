# Chapter 0

As I went through my mathematical career, there were many instances when I thought, ‘**I wish someone had told me that earlier.**’ This is a collection of such advice.

# Chapter 1 Sets and functions

A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
The empty set has no elements.
The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements in the set.
The set Y is a subset of X if every element of Y is in X.
A subset Y of X is a proper subset if it is not equal to X.
The union of X and Y is the collection of elements that are in X or in Y .
The intersection of X and Y is the collection of elements that are in X and in Y .
The product of X and Y is the set of all pairs (x, y) where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y .
A function assigns elements of one set to another.
