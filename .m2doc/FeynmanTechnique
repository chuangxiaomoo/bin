There are four simple steps to the Feynman Technique, which I'll explain below:

1 Choose a Concept
2 Teach it to a _Toddler_
3 Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material
3 Review and Simplify

# 两种知识：

The famous Nobel winning physicist Richard Feynman understood the difference between 
knowing something and knowing the name of something and it's one of the most important reasons for his success.

Commenting on what it means to have knowledge, in How To Read A Book, Mortimer Adler writes: 

    “The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.”

Learning is reaching. Passively reading a book—a relatively effortless process, letting the words wash over you like a warm bath—doesn’t put you in the sweet spot. Less reaching equals less learning.


# 读书一定要思考

Most people go through life not really getting any smarter. Why? They simply won’t do the work `required`.

When asked how to get smarter, Buffett once held up stacks of paper and said “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.“

But how you read matters too.

You need to be critical and always thinking. You need to do the mental work required to hold an opinion.


# How can you find time to read?

Charlie, as a very young lawyer, was probably getting $20 an hour. He thought to himself, _‘Who’s my most valuable client?’_ And he decided it was himself. So he decided to sell himself an hour each day. He did it early in the morning, working on these construction projects and real estate deals. Everybody should do this, be the client, and then work for other people, too, and sell yourself an hour a day.
